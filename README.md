# deck.gl 9.x - Animated Particle Layer

This is a minimum example of an animated particle layer for deck.gl versions 9.1 and up.

There's a [demo on my website](https://az.id.au/demo/deck-particle-layer/) where you'll also find a [tutorial and write up](https://az.id.au/dev/wind-particle-layer-in-deckgl-9.x/) on how to modify an animated particle layer built for older versions of [deck.gl](https://deck.gl) or [luma.gl](https://luma.gl/) (such as the 8.x era).

You'll need to have your own data source for the wind data, I've used [NOAA's GFS (Global Forecast System)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast)
